## Coding Stadards:   <br>
There are a number of coding standards that must be followed when commiting new features.   <br> 
These include:

- **Understandability:** The code must be easy to follow and understand what the function of it is.

-	**Long Methods:** Methods that are too long must be divided up into smaller methods.

-	**Appropriate Variable Names:** Variables have meaningful names.

-	**Comments:** All changes must have descriptive comments, no longer than one line each.

-	**Efficiency:** Code should be written in the most efficient way possible.

-	**Tests:** An adequate number of test must be written for each new feature.


## Code Review:  <br/>
The following are a set of criteria that must be followed when performing a code review:

- **Avoid Emotions**  <br>
Using emotion when performing a code review can be extremly counter productive. When providing feedback, avoid using negative or insulting language. Ensure that the feedback is professional and productive.

- **Be to the point:**<br>
It is vital that code reviews are performed efficiently. For this reason any feedback given must be to the point. Avoiding giving honest and consise feedback can be detrimental to the entire team. 

- **Make feedback useful:**<br>
When providing feedback as part of a code review, give the person productive feedback, possibly providing them with resources or documentation to help them to improve their programming.

- **Include all team members in reviews:**<br>
Allow all members in your team to take part in the code review process. This can help other team members to avoid previous mistakes made by other members. It can also be a good learning opportunity for any junior developers in your team.
